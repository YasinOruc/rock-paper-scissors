# Project: Rock Paper Scissors - Foundations Course

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Rock Paper Scissors" project, a part of the Foundations Course. This project is an implementation of the grade-school classic game, “rock paper scissors”. Initially, the game is played via the browser console. The intention is to revisit this project to add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in a later lesson, so it’s crucial to maintain the code on GitHub for future enhancements.

## Project Timeline
- **Start Date:** March 16, 2023, 10:21 AM
- **Completion Date:** March 18, 2023, 1:00 PM
- **Location:** Odido Headquarters, Den Haag
- **Special Note:** This project was completed during lunch breaks in the month of Ramadan.

## Development Environment
- **Device Used:** MacBook
- **Note:** The project was pre-planned to be completed during lunch breaks.

## Project Instructions
### Quick Exercises Before Starting:
1. Identify three ways to include JavaScript in a page.
2. Test `console.log("Hello World");` in JavaScript and check if it displays in the browser’s console.

### Assignment:
1. Start a new Git repo for your project.
2. Create a blank HTML document with a script tag. Link an external `.js` file for best practices.
3. Implement a function `getComputerChoice` to randomly return ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’, or ‘Scissors’.
4. Write a function `playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)` that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors and returns a string declaring the winner or tie.
   - Make `playerSelection` parameter case-insensitive.
   - Test the function using `console.log`.
5. Create a new function `playGame()` to play a five-round game, keeping score and reporting the winner or loser at the end.
   - Use `console.log()` to display round results and the final winner.
   - Use `prompt()` for user input.

### Additional Notes:
- Early and frequent commits to Git are encouraged. Refer to the Commit Message lesson.
- Feel free to use loops if familiar, otherwise, sequential function calls are fine.
- Modification of functions for efficiency and clarity is encouraged.
- Creation of additional helper functions is recommended for a clean and manageable code structure.

## Future Work
Remember to revisit and update this project with a GUI as part of the course progression.
